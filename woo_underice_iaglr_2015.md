## Just how broad is interest in under ice ecology?

--- #custbgcloud

\>100 survey responses, \>80 with data on:

## Challenges for synthesis

1. Managing communications
2. Integrating heterogeneous data
3. Building a sense of community
4. Incentives

## Data Template

---

## Goals

1. Integrate data as seamlessly as possible
2. Encourage sharing
3. Use researchers' system-specific knowledge

## Policies

Document describing how data will be used and shared

Internally to collaborators first, then eventually public

Policies shared early and often

--- .segue .dark

## Validate Data

---

## R package `icetest`

* Be responsive
* Centralize communication
* Plan ahead for data integration
* Validate the data
* Be inclusive
* Communicate expectations early and often
